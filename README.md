Download JavaFX version 21.0.2 LTS or later for your platform at https://openjfx.io/.
Make an user library from the JavaFX library .jar files, include them in modulepath in project build path properties,
include module path files in run configurations -> dependencies -> add modules from --- to ALL-MODULE-PATH.

To make an executable .jar file, export runnable .jar from eclipse with package required libraries into generated JAR.
After generating application .jar, add platform specific javafx jars and binaries to the root of the .jar zip file.
